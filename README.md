# tc7200-stats
Graph live statistics from Technicolor TC7200.
Made for **personal use** on `STDD.01.05`, but it might work with other versions as well.

## Requirements
Are all specified in `package.json`, so you needn't manually obtain them (see Installation)
* electron
* chart.js

## Installation
Clone and run `npm install`. After installation run `npm start` to start.

## Configuration
Put your details in the connection dialog upon the application's startup.  
Alternatively, edit the regular expressions in `js/index.js`

## Etc
It's kind of ugly because all of the JS copypasta, but hey, there's no way around that...
